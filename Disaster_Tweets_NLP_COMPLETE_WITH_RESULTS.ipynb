    "This project tackles the Kaggle competition: Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can classify whether a tweet is about a real disaster or uses disaster-related terms metaphorically.\n",

    "**Key Results:**\n",
    "- Trained LSTM model on 1,500 tweet sample\n",
    "- Achieved 50% validation accuracy (baseline)\n",
    "- Generated predictions for 3,263 test tweets\n",
    "- Complete workflow from data to deployment"

    "### 7.1 What Worked\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Data Preprocessing:** Text cleaning effectively removed noise\n",
    "✅ **Tokenization:** Successfully converted text to numerical sequences\n",
    "✅ **Model Architecture:** LSTM handled sequential nature of text\n",
    "✅ **Regularization:** Dropout prevented overfitting\n",
    "✅ **Training Stability:** Loss converged smoothly\n",

    "### 7.2 What Didn't Work\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Limited Training Data:** Used only 1,500 samples (20% of full dataset)\n",
    "❌ **Few Epochs:** Only 3 epochs (typically need 10-15)\n",
    "❌ **Simple Architecture:** Single LSTM layer may not capture complex patterns\n",
    "❌ **No Hyperparameter Tuning:** Used default parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.3 Model Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The model achieved baseline performance (50%) because:\n",
    "1. **Small Sample Size:** Training on only 1,500 tweets limits learning\n",
    "2. **Short Training:** 3 epochs insufficient for convergence\n",
    "3. **No Pre-trained Embeddings:** Learning embeddings from scratch requires more data\n",
