## 🎯 What YOU Need to Do (Simple!)

### STEP 1: Run the Notebook (30-60 minutes)

**Option A: Run on Kaggle (RECOMMENDED - Free GPU!)**
1. Go to https://www.kaggle.com
2. Create a new notebook
3. Upload `Disaster_Tweets_NLP_Classification.ipynb`
4. Data is already there! Just click "Add Data" → "nlp-getting-started"
5. Enable GPU (Settings → Accelerator → GPU)
6. Click "Run All"
7. Wait for training to complete (~30-45 minutes)
8. Download the generated `submission.csv`

**Option B: Run Locally**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook Disaster_Tweets_NLP_Classification.ipynb

# Run all cells
```

### STEP 2: Create GitHub Repository (10 minutes)

1. **Go to GitHub.com and create new repository:**
   - Name: `disaster-tweets-nlp` (or any name you like)
   - Description: "NLP project for disaster tweet classification"
   - Make it **PUBLIC** (important for peer review!)
   - Don't initialize with README (we have our own)

2. **Upload files to GitHub:**
   
   **Option A: Using Git (if you know Git)**
   ```bash
   cd project_files
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Disaster Tweets NLP Project"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/disaster-tweets-nlp.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   **Option B: Upload via GitHub Website (Easiest)**
   - Go to your new repository
   - Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
   - Drag and drop ALL files from `project_files` folder
   - Click "Commit changes"

3. **Copy your GitHub repository URL**
   - Should look like: `https://github.com/yourusername/disaster-tweets-nlp`

### STEP 3: Submit to Kaggle (5 minutes)

1. Go to: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/submit
2. Click "Submit Predictions"
3. Upload your `submission.csv` file (generated from notebook)
4. Submit and wait for score
5. **Take a screenshot** of the leaderboard showing:
   - Your username
   - Your score
   - Your rank
6. Save screenshot as `kaggle_leaderboard.png`

### STEP 4: Submit to Course (5 minutes)

**Deliverable 1:** Upload the notebook
- File: `Disaster_Tweets_NLP_Classification.ipynb`

**Deliverable 2:** Submit GitHub URL
- Your repository link

**Deliverable 3:** Upload screenshot
- File: `kaggle_leaderboard.png`

## ⚡ Quick Tips

- **Use GPU:** Kaggle Notebooks have free GPU - much faster!
- **Don't Panic:** If models take 10-15 minutes to train, that's normal
- **It's OK if scores vary:** Neural networks have randomness
- **Read the notebook:** Lots of explanations and learning material
- **Ask questions:** If something is unclear, check the markdown cells

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"I don't have a Kaggle account"**
- Create one for free at kaggle.com - takes 2 minutes

**"I don't have a GitHub account"**
- Create one for free at github.com - takes 2 minutes

**"Training takes too long"**
- Use Kaggle Notebooks with GPU (free!)
- Or reduce EPOCHS to 10 in the notebook

**"I don't understand something"**
- Read the markdown explanations in the notebook
- Check QUICKSTART.md for simple instructions
- Look at PROJECT_SUMMARY.md for rubric breakdown

**"My Kaggle score is lower than expected"**
- That's OK! Focus is on analysis, not score
- Anything above 0.70 is acceptable
- Explain your approach well in the notebook
